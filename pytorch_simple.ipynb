More isn't listed at UFC's site so I presume that the card isn't finished yet? But are there any rumors or any other things that indicate which fighters may participate?  I had the best seats in the house money can buy last year and planning to buy the same again tomorrow when the pre sale starts (in exactly 13h from now). But I don't want to pay $375 USD if the only good fight is the main event (Alexander Gustafsson FTW!)...

       "404069  Whole fight card for UFC on Fuel TV 9, 6th April in Stockholm, Sweden? I've been looking around for the card for this upcoming event, but I can't find more than three fights. More isn't listed at UFC's site so I presume that the card isn't finished yet? But are there any rumors or any other things that indicate which fighters may participate?  I had the best seats in the house money can buy last year and planning to buy the same again tomorrow when the pre sale starts (in exactly 13h from now). But I don't want to pay $375 USD if the only good fight is the main event (Alexander Gustafsson FTW!)... All information/rumours/indications is appreciated ASAP so I can decide how much money I'm willing to pay for the tickets?   \n",

       "404069  Whole fight card for UFC on Fuel TV 9, 6th April in Stockholm, Sweden? I've been looking around for the card for this upcoming event, but I can't find more than three fights. More isn't listed at UFC's site so I presume that the card isn't finished yet? But are there any rumors or any other things that indicate which fighters may participate?  I had the best seats in the house money can buy last year and planning to buy the same again tomorrow when the pre sale starts (in exactly 13h from now). But I don't want to pay $375 USD if the only good fight is the main event (Alexander Gustafsson FTW!)... All information/rumours/indications is appreciated ASAP so I can decide how much money I'm willing to pay for the tickets?   \n",

       "4326    I have been married almost 15 years. We have two children, 11 and 8. My childhood was horrible, seven years of sexual, physical, and mental/emotional abuse followed by instability and low self esteem issues as a teen. My husband met me after I began dealing with my childhood and knew all about my issues. He knew what would end our marriage, yet he did it and lied about it multiple times. I was pregnant and did not leave. We tried to make it work. We had another child. We have been through MANY \"situations\" in our marriage and as parents. For the past 6-8 years we have just been living as parents. Not lovers. In the past I tried everything to make our marriage work. I finally decided to be done with it. Now he says he loves me and wants to make it work. But he is manipulative and can be so mean. He uses my children to cause me pain and stress. He knows that they are the only reason I stay. We are in counciling, but I really have no \"love\" feelings for him. I told him I want a divorce, but he won't give me one. He has said he will make my life miserable until the 18 months of separation are up and divorce is granted. Any advice? I'm ready to run away...   \n",

Each  had 30 oranges. The first lady sold oranges at 2 for a rupee and second lady sold oranges at 3 for rupee. At last, the first and second lady made Rs 15 and Rs 10 respectively. So the total amount is Rs 25. The next day, when they sold their 30 oranges together to make business profitable, they pooled their sixty oranges and sold at rate of 5 for Rs 2. After they sold all oranges, they found they had only Rs 24. They could not understand where the one rupee went. Where did it go?   \n",

I've been looking around for the card for this upcoming event, but I can't find more than three fights. More isn't listed at UFC's site so I presume that the card isn't finished yet? But are there any rumors or any other things that indicate which fighters may participate?  I had the best seats in the house money can buy last year and planning to buy the same again tomorrow when the pre sale starts (in exactly 13h from now). But I don't want to pay $375 USD if the only good fight is the main event (Alexander Gustafsson FTW!)... All information/rumours/indications is appreciated ASAP so I can decide how much money I'm willing to pay for the tickets?   \n",

I was pregnant and did not leave. We tried to make it work. We had another child. We have been through MANY \"situations\" in our marriage and as parents. For the past 6-8 years we have just been living as parents. Not lovers. In the past I tried everything to make our marriage work. I finally decided to be done with it. Now he says he loves me and wants to make it work. But he is manipulative and can be so mean. He uses my children to cause me pain and stress. He knows that they are the only reason I stay. We are in counciling, but I really have no \"love\" feelings for him. I told him I want a divorce, but he won't give me one. He has said he will make my life miserable until the 18 months of separation are up and divorce is granted. Any advice? I'm ready to run away...</td>\n",

       "4326    I have been married almost 15 years. We have two children, 11 and 8. My childhood was horrible, seven years of sexual, physical, and mental/emotional abuse followed by instability and low self esteem issues as a teen. My husband met me after I began dealing with my childhood and knew all about my issues. He knew what would end our marriage, yet he did it and lied about it multiple times. I was pregnant and did not leave. We tried to make it work. We had another child. We have been through MANY \"situations\" in our marriage and as parents. For the past 6-8 years we have just been living as parents. Not lovers. In the past I tried everything to make our marriage work. I finally decided to be done with it. Now he says he loves me and wants to make it work. But he is manipulative and can be so mean. He uses my children to cause me pain and stress. He knows that they are the only reason I stay. We are in counciling, but I really have no \"love\" feelings for him. I told him I want a divorce, but he won't give me one. He has said he will make my life miserable until the 18 months of separation are up and divorce is granted. Any advice? I'm ready to run away...   \n",

We acquire the heart beat through diaphragm and and after amplifying it, the signal is fed to the sound card of laptop through the 3.5mm jack. The signal is then processed in MATLAB and then displayed on the screen. The problem I encountered was the input signal to the sound  card is too noisy. Ambient noise is preventing the accurate acquisition. How to filter out the noise?   \n",

(as opposed to in the U.S.)? --- for the purpose of search engine rankings?  Or are there any other extremely low-cost (non-US) web-hosting options for multiple websites domains to be used for a massive reverse SEO program? Any ideas or thoughts would be helpful - more for the purpose of setting multiple domains with as many keywords in the url itself.   \n",

       "397439                    Heartbreak? Heartbreak? She's my girlfriend for two months, I chose her over my girlfriend for 2 years. I like her so much to the point that I can't let her go even if she wants to end our relationship because of the other people around us most especially her family. I do the things for her that I'm not used to for a girl and I am willing to sacrifice everything just to have a little time with her. A little and limited time that I'm asking from her but she don't wanna give it to me. She's scared that someone might see us, that she's still having an affair with me. I love her and I want to be with her at least once a week even if just for a limited time. I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing, all of my friends told me to stop it and just let it go 2 months is just 2 months not a deep relationship. But they don't feel what I feel, in this span of time I learned a lot, I learned how to love, to be loved, to sacrifice a good life, and to sacrifice a better clear future. My mind tells me to stop, but my heart tells me to hold, don't give up, stay with her and give her the unconditional love. Should I follow my mind or follow my heart?   \n",

Each  had 30 oranges. The first lady sold oranges at 2 for a rupee and second lady sold oranges at 3 for rupee. At last, the first and second lady made Rs 15 and Rs 10 respectively. So the total amount is Rs 25. The next day, when they sold their 30 oranges together to make business profitable, they pooled their sixty oranges and sold at rate of 5 for Rs 2. After they sold all oranges, they found they had only Rs 24. They could not understand where the one rupee went. Where did it go?   \n",

I've been looking around for the card for this upcoming event, but I can't find more than three fights. More isn't listed at UFC's site so I presume that the card isn't finished yet? But are there any rumors or any other things that indicate which fighters may participate?  I had the best seats in the house money can buy last year and planning to buy the same again tomorrow when the pre sale starts (in exactly 13h from now). But I don't want to pay $375 USD if the only good fight is the main event (Alexander Gustafsson FTW!)... All information/rumours/indications is appreciated ASAP so I can decide how much money I'm willing to pay for the tickets?   \n",

       "404069  Whole fight card for UFC on Fuel TV 9, 6th April in Stockholm, Sweden? I've been looking around for the card for this upcoming event, but I can't find more than three fights. More isn't listed at UFC's site so I presume that the card isn't finished yet? But are there any rumors or any other things that indicate which fighters may participate?  I had the best seats in the house money can buy last year and planning to buy the same again tomorrow when the pre sale starts (in exactly 13h from now). But I don't want to pay $375 USD if the only good fight is the main event (Alexander Gustafsson FTW!)... All information/rumours/indications is appreciated ASAP so I can decide how much money I'm willing to pay for the tickets?   \n",
